# Description

Trying to store configs in a git repo.
I use is a very simple tmux configuration file that basically changes colors and add vim bindings.
I also link some usefull vim plugins that are installed with pathogen.

# Installation
Run
```
./install.sh
```
If you want some docker aliases
```
cp .docker_aliases ~/.docker_aliases
# add . ~/.docker_aliases in your ~/.bashrc
echo '. ~/.docker_aliases' >> ~/.bashrc
```
